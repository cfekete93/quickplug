Overview
--------

The goal of quickplug is to allow for an easy to use framework which enables
developers the ability to add plugin mechanisms to their projects. The
framework allows developers to add there own code as 'internal' plugins while
providing mechanisms for third-party extensions to be added as 'external'.
Currently quickplug wraps the native argparse library by creating subparsers
to handle argument parsing for each plugin.
